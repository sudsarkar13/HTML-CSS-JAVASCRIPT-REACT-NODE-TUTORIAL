## **Block-Level Elements**

A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". Browsers typically display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element.

The Block-Level Elements are:

`<address>` `<article>` `<aside>` `<blockquote>` `<canvas>` `<dd>` `<div>` `<dl>` `<dt>` `<fieldset>` `<figcaption>` `<figure>` `<footer>` `<form>` `<h1>-<h6>` `<header>` `<hr>` `<li>` `<main>` `<nav>` `<noscript>` `<ol>` `<p>` `<pre>` `<section>` `<table>` `<tfoot>` `<ul>` `<video>`

## **Inline-Level Elements**

Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.

The Inline-Level Elements are:

`<a>` `<abbr>` `<acronym>` `<b>` `<bdo>` `<big>` `<br>` `<button>` `<cite>` `<code>` `<dfn>` `<em>` `<i>` `<img>` `<input>` `<kbd>` `<label>` `<map>` `<object>` `<output>` `<q>` `<samp>` `<script>` `<select>` `<small>` `<span>` `<strong>` `<sub>` `<sup>` `<textarea>` `<time>` `<tt>` `<var>`

**Types of Web Developers/Development:**

1. `Front-End Web Developer`: Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
2. `Back-End Web Developer`: Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It is the term used for the behind-the-scenes activities that happen when performing any action on a website. It can be logging in to your account or purchasing a watch from an online store.
3. `Full-Stack Web Developer`: A full-stack web developer is a technology expert who can work on both in the front end & back-end of any application. Front-end is also called the client-side as it is visible to the user whereas back-end is the server-side & not visible to the user.
